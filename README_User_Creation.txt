Ethan Kent. Programming for IT
Miniproject2

The program is designed to log users and their passwords while also encrypting the password.
It checks if someone is an existing user and prompts them for their password.
The user has 3 trys to enter the password, if succesful it wll be logged with the date and time and "OK".
if a user fails they will be asked to try again and be logged as a failed log in.
If they have no user they may make a user.
Entering their first and last name will create a user with thier first enital and last name and 4 random digits.
once this is done they will be asked to make a password and re-enter it to confirm it is correct.
after it will be appended to the users file with their encrypted password.

Running the code: When making a new user it will give an error but the user is still logged with their password to users.txt.
The rest should run as normal once a user is made. If a user is entered incorrectly an error occurs as well.
There are most likely more errors but what I have I'm proud of.

On this project I had help with figuring out a lot of the formatting and with searching through strings and accessing the file to read.
As well as indexing to alter the strings and the encryption fucntion. I got this help from Professor Penta.
